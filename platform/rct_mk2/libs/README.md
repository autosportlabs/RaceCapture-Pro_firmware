# Various Library Notes


## STM32 USB Libraries:
1. For USB Host/OTG support, you will need to provide a usb\_conf.h
   file tailored to your application.  For the USB device library, you
   will need to include a usbd\_conf.h file. For examples, please see [ST's
   usb project examples](http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF257882)
