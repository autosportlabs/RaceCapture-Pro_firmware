* Refactor stage logic to support multiple stage runs without restarting unit.

  apply as in circuit racing).
* Replace start/finish cool off timer with geoTrigger to prevent false start/finish
  events when driver is stuck at start/finish for whatever reason.
* Add the elapsed channel.  This channel provides the time elapsed since the lap
  first began in minutes.  Useful for seeing current lap time of the driver.
* Add the CurrentLap channel. Increments when lap timing starts; as opposed to
  LapCount which increments when the lap completes.

===2.7.7===
* Allow cell module to connect to roaming network (roaming charges may apply)
* MK1: fix RPM stuck at zero if RPM signal is applied before RCP unit is powered up

===2.7.4===
* Fixed addChannel() return value upon successful creation of channel

===2.7.3===
* Padded all OBDII PID requests with 0x55 to the full 8 byte message for maximum ECU compatibility.
* Corrected Lua initCAN() api call to match documentation
* Fixed GPS Distance bug.  Now provided in Miles instead of Km (Because I get 40 rods to the Hogs head and that's the way I likes it...)

===2.7.2===
Only disconnect telemetry upon sustained (10) malformed API message. Resend metadata if telemetry connection is restarted.
