* Improved usage of newlib libc to reduce code duplication internally.
* Upgraded SD card driver and FATFS subsystem.  Result is a very
  stable SD card system.
* Created new AT subsystem for use with all AT modems (ESP8266,
  U-Blox).  Used with ESP8266 currently.
* Audited and fixed all IRQ values to be lower than those of FreeRTOS
  to ensure no interrupt conflicts.

  be aligned on even bytes.
* Added delays to GPS command responses so we can be sure the GPS chips is
  caught up before the next command is sent. Otherwise we see sporadic
  failures.

  enable usart interrupts on usart channels where DMA was used.
* Fixed compilation on GCC 6 toolchain.

  https://github.com/autosportlabs/RaceCapture-Pro_firmware/issues/619
* Improved SD Card operations by removing duplicate initialization issue and
  removing unnecessary critical task guards which lead to long system pauses.
  Other pauses remain, but the SD card logging no longer blocks preemption.
  https://github.com/autosportlabs/RaceCapture-Pro_firmware/issues/571
* Back ported fix for the dual malloc issue.  We were unintentionally running
  both the FreeRTOS allocator and the glibc allocator.  Fortunately this did
  not cause issues because we made very limited use of the glibc allocator.
  This patch adds the code so that we always use the FreeRTOS allocator, even
  if we use glibc malloc/realloc/calloc/free calls.
  https://github.com/autosportlabs/RaceCapture-Pro_firmware/issues/565

* Removed unused CAN TX queues in MK2 hal to improve memory
  https://github.com/autosportlabs/RaceCapture-Pro_firmware/issues/553

  was added to the mailbox to send.
  https://github.com/autosportlabs/RaceCapture-Pro_firmware/issues/549
* Drastically improved Lua GC behavior; built Lua Test script to prove it.
  https://github.com/autosportlabs/RaceCapture-Pro_firmware/issues/476

= 2.9.0 =
* Fixed Lua stack overflow bug by increasing Lua Stack size (Issue #411)
* Fixed timer input so it resets to 0 when no input detected (Issue #418)
* Added RPM filtering in software to get rid of unrealistic engine speed
  values (Issue #430). NOTE: The new quiet period logic uses your maximum
  and pulse per revolution values to calculate the quiet period. Ensure
  your maximum RPM and pulse per revolution values are set correctly.
* Fixed Lua onTick timing bug that was causing Lua to wait longer than it
  should between onTick events. (Issue #433)
* Quieted various Lua memory alloc/free messages (Issue #410)

  faster than other channels, it would not record. (Issue #444)
* Added new OBD-II PIDs into our OBD-II system.  Special thanks to
  Justin Imhoff (https://github.com/imhoffj) for the patch.

  Now it will error with detailed information if a user supplies an invalid
  input parameter or an invalid sample rate. (Issue #424)
* Fix USB suspend bug that causes device to go non-responsive when put into
  suspend mode. (Issue #426)
* Fixed timer prescalar skew caused by varying timer speeds settings.  Now all
  timer speeds report correct values (when frequency is within the timer
  measurement range of course.  A good test is 100Hz). (Issue #435)
* Fixed telemetry destination.  Currently set to telemetry.race-capture.com
  (Issue #341)
* Removed MK1 platform from build tree.
* Improve unit test infrastructure to compile all firmware code strictly in
  C (was C compiled as C++) and test accordingly.

  mappings of RCP units to ensure that default orientation of MK2 matches this
  exactly.
* Added Lua method to get GPS altitude in Lua runtime. (Issue #397)
* Fixed timeout support on Lua CAN tx method.  (Issue #404)
* Merged RaceCapture codebase into this mainline project.
* Add dynamic cellular modem support.  This allows us to support both our current
  sim900 card and the new ublox-sara 3G cards. (Issue #182)
* Added support for up to 100 virtual channels in Lua.  Up from 30. (Issue #414)
* Adjusted internal process priorities so that the logging snapshot process
  runs with this highest priority.  This is to ensure that we never miss time a
  snap-shot operation.
* Improve `onTick` method in Lua to be able to run at 1000Hz maximum rate.  Not
  gauranteed to run at that rate (depends on how much Lua code there is to parse)
  but local testing shows its possible to do if code is optimized. (Issue #423)
* Added a new `getChannel` method in Lua so users don't have to maintain virtual
  channel values in Lua environment variables if they want to later calculate
  additional channels using the recorded virtual channel values. (Issue #456)
* Add additional version information to the firmware.  Now include build type
  (release, beta, dev) and a git description string. (Issue #436)
* Fixed up LED mappings, added deterministic LED control code to firmware.  This
  prevents us from turning the wrong LED on or off due to different LED mappings
  between RaceCapture platforms. (Issue #437)
* Fixed up Lua setLed method to be consistent on which LED is set and to also allow
  the user to specify an LED based on a string identifier to be able to control it.
  (Issue #437)
* Improved our timer by adding support for selecting which edge we want to use for
  timing measurements (Default is falling).  Also allows the user to specify the
  a quiet period for filtering if they wish to override the automatically calculated
  value.  A value of 0 will disable the filtering altogether.  A value < 0 sets the
  code into automatic calculation mode. (Issue #464)
* Fixed OBD-II speed conversion from kph to mph

  restored to the default.  Please back up your scripts prior to upgrading.

  count up.

  events when driver is stuck at start/finish for whatever reason.
* Add the elapsed channel.  This channel provides the time elapsed since the lap
  first began in minutes.  Useful for seeing current lap time of the driver.

  LapCount which increments when the lap completes.
