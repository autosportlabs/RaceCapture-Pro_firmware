/* This file abstracts the Posix Messaging Queue to allow for Inter-Process Communication.
 * The interface is designed to be event driven, ie when a message is received a process
 * signal is fired which collects the data and passes it to a registered call back function.
 *
 * Type 'man mq_overview' on the command line to get more details.
 *
 * The limits on my system are (/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/):
 * 		msg_max:		10		At most ten messages waiting in a queue.
 * 		msgsize_max		8192	At most 8192 bytes per message.
 * 		queues_max		256		At most 256 message queues.
