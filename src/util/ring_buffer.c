/**
 * This ring buffer is designed to be as optimal as possible for the
 * FreeRTOS environment.  Using memcpy allows underlying layer to use
 * native register copying to speed up operations.  Also allowing the
 * user to put in more data than free space is available allows for
 * maximum flexibility at the cost of inheriently being SPSC threadsafe.
 * The buffer still meets that requirement if the user DOES NOT put in
 * more data than the buffer has free space available.  That choice is
 * intentionally left to the user to decide.
